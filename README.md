Milestone 3 consists of 3 main tasks:

Task 1:

Task 2:

The aim of this task was to check whether the guess is in the word

Task 3:

The aim of this task was to clean up the preceeding code by creating functions. Functions check_guess and ask_for_input were created.
check_guess checks whether the guess letter in the arg is in the word or not.
ask_for_input checks whether the entered letter is actually a letter or not.


Task 4:

For this task, the aim was to modify the check_guess method to deal with letters that are not in the chosen word.
